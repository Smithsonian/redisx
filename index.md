__RedisX__ is a light-weight [Redis](https://redis.io) client for C/C++. As such, it should also work with Redis forks 
/ clones like [Dragonfly](https://dragonfly.io) or [Valkey](https://valkey.io). It supports both interactive and 
pipelined Redis queries, managing and processing subscriptions. It also supports atomic execution blocks and LUA 
scripts loading. It can be used with one or more distinct Redis servers simultaneously.

While there are other C/C++ Redis clients available, this one is C90 compatible, and hence can be used on older 
platforms also. It is also small and fast, but still capable and versatile.

The __RedisX__ library was created, and is maintained, by Attila Kov√°cs at the Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard 
&amp; Smithsonian, and it is available through the [Smithsonian/redisx](https://github.com/Smithsonian/redisx) 
repository on GitHub.
